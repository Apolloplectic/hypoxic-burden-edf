# Hypoxic Burden Calculator - REFACTORED VERSION

## 🎯 Overview

This is a **completely refactored** version of the Hypoxic Burden Calculator that adds significant improvements to code organization and maintainability.

---

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Global Hypoxic Burden (FULLY IMPLEMENTED)

**What was broken:**
- Missing `use_global_hb` checkbox
- No calculation logic for global HB
- Baseline calculation not working

**What's fixed:**
- ✅ Added checkbox (defaults to `True`) in Advanced Settings
- ✅ Full implementation of global HB calculation:
  - Calculates area above SpO₂ curve: `∫(100 - SpO₂) dt`
  - Subtracts rectangular area above baseline: `(100 - baseline) × duration`
  - Global HB = desaturation area / 60 / hours
- ✅ Two baseline calculation methods:
  - **Automatic (default)**: 95th percentile of SpO₂ (filters out desaturations)
  - **Manual**: User can enter custom baseline
- ✅ Results displayed in UI with baseline used
- ✅ Included in PDF reports

**Location in code:**
- `analysis_engine.py`: `calculate_global_hypoxic_burden()` method
- `app.py`: Lines 175-195 (UI controls)

---

### 2. ✅ YASA Integration (FULLY FIXED)

**What was broken:**
- `YASA_AVAILABLE` undefined, causing crashes
- YASA not properly integrated with sleep staging

**What's fixed:**
- ✅ Proper YASA import handling in `config.py`:
  ```python
  try:
      import yasa
      YASA_AVAILABLE = True
  except ImportError:
      YASA_AVAILABLE = False
  ```
- ✅ Automatic fallback hierarchy:
  1. MIT gold standard (if `.st` file present)
  2. YASA deep learning (if installed + EEG present + sampling ≥100 Hz)
  3. Rule-based spectral analysis (fallback)
- ✅ Clear status messages in UI showing which method is being used
- ✅ Footer shows YASA status (✅ or ❌)

**Location in code:**
- `config.py`: Lines 6-11 (import handling)
- `analysis_engine.py`: `perform_sleep_staging()` method (lines 309-330)
- `analysis_engine.py`: `_yasa_staging()` method (lines 332-365)

---

### 3. ✅ Batch Processing (FULLY IMPLEMENTED)

**What was broken:**
- Used placeholder values instead of actual analysis
- Global HB not calculated in batch mode

**What's fixed:**
- ✅ Each file in batch gets **full analysis** (same as single-file mode)
- ✅ All metrics calculated: AHI, ODI, Obstructive HB, Global HB
- ✅ Individual PDF reports generated for each file
- ✅ Master summary PDF with table of all results
- ✅ ZIP file contains:
  - `Reports/` folder with individual PDFs
  - `Master_Summary.pdf` with aggregated data
- ✅ Progress tracking and pause/resume functionality
- ✅ Error handling (skips problematic files, continues processing)

**Location in code:**
- `app.py`: Lines 489-655 (complete batch pipeline)

---

### 4. ✅ File Size Limits (EXPLAINED + SOLUTION PROVIDED)

**What was the issue:**
- Streamlit cloud has a **hard 200 MB upload limit**
- This is a Streamlit Cloud restriction, not a code issue

**Solution:**
- ✅ Clear instructions for running locally with **4 GB support**:
  ```bash
  streamlit run app.py --server.maxUploadSize=4096
  ```
- ✅ Expandable instruction panel in UI (lines 57-100)
- ✅ Step-by-step guide:
  1. Install Python 3.9+
  2. Download app from GitHub
  3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  4. Run with increased file size limit
- ✅ Online version shows warnings when files exceed limits
- ✅ Batch mode checks limits and provides helpful error messages

**Important:** The 200 MB limit **cannot be bypassed** when running on Streamlit Cloud. Users MUST run locally for larger files.

---

### 5. ✅ Code Organization (MASSIVELY IMPROVED)

**What was broken:**
- Everything in one 800+ line file
- Hard to maintain and debug
- Functions mixed with UI code

**What's fixed:**
- ✅ **Modular architecture** with 5 separate files:

#### File Structure:
```
hypoxic_burden_calculator/
├── app.py                  # Main Streamlit UI (420 lines)
├── analysis_engine.py      # Core PSG analysis logic (550 lines)
├── pdf_generator.py        # PDF report generation (330 lines)
├── utils.py                # Utility functions (150 lines)
├── config.py               # Configuration & constants (60 lines)
└── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
```

#### `app.py` - Main UI
- Streamlit interface only
- User inputs and display
- File upload handling
- Calls analysis engine for processing

#### `analysis_engine.py` - Core Analysis (`PSGAnalyzer` class)
- **Channel Detection**: Auto-detects SpO₂, airflow, EEG, EOG, EMG
- **MIT Annotations**: Loads `.st` files for gold standard
- **Preprocessing**: SpO₂ resampling, artifact filtering
- **Event Detection**: 
  - Airflow-based (accurate)
  - SpO₂-based fallback
- **Sleep Staging**: MIT → YASA → Rule-based
- **Obstructive HB**: Event-specific calculation + bootstrap CI
- **Global HB**: Whole-study area below baseline
- **Full Pipeline**: `run_full_analysis()` orchestrates everything

#### `pdf_generator.py` - Report Generation (`PDFReportGenerator` class)
- Individual file reports
- Batch summary reports
- Azarbarzin-style overlay plots
- Professional formatting with ReportLab

#### `utils.py` - Helpers
- Session state initialization
- EDF file loading
- Channel detection
- Baseline calculation
- File cleanup

#### `config.py` - Constants
- YASA availability check
- Default parameters
- Channel name patterns
- Risk thresholds
- File size limits

## 📊 What Gets Calculated

### Obstructive Hypoxic Burden (Event-Specific)
- Based on Azarbarzin et al., EHJ 2019
- For each apnea/hypopnea event:
  1. Find baseline SpO₂ from pre-event window (default 100s)
  2. Calculate area below baseline in desaturation window (-60s to +120s)
  3. Sum all event areas, divide by total sleep time
- **Output**: (%min)/h with 95% CI from bootstrap

### Global Hypoxic Burden (Whole-Study)
- NEW feature you requested
- Measures total "oxygen debt" over entire night
- Method:
  1. Calculate total area above SpO₂ curve: `∫(100 - SpO₂) dt`
  2. Calculate rectangular area above baseline: `(100 - baseline) × duration`
  3. Global desaturation area = difference
  4. Divide by total hours
- **Baseline**: 95th percentile of SpO₂ (auto) or user-defined
- **Output**: (%min)/h

### Other Metrics
- **AHI**: Apnea-Hypopnea Index (events per hour)
- **ODI**: Oxygen Desaturation Index (≥3% or ≥4% drops per hour)
- **Stage-specific**: All metrics broken down by sleep stage

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **200 MB cloud limit**: Cannot be bypassed. Run locally for larger files.
2. **YASA requirements**: Needs EEG channel + ≥100 Hz sampling rate
3. **Airflow detection**: More accurate with dedicated airflow channel
4. **Batch processing**: Online limited to 5 files / 1 GB total

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "YASA not available"
```bash
pip install yasa
```

### "File too large" error
Run locally with:
```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.maxUploadSize=4096
```

### "SpO₂ channel not found"
Your EDF file must contain a channel with one of these names:
- SPO2, SAO2, SaO2, SpO2

### Stage-specific results show "Total" only
- Missing EEG channel, or
- EEG sampling rate < 100 Hz, or
- YASA not installed (using fallback)
